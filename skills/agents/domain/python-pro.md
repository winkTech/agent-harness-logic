## Skill Invocation Protocol (MANDATORY)

**Use the Skill tool to invoke skills, not just read them:**

```javascript
// Invoke skills to apply their workflows
Skill({ skill: 'python-backend-expert' }); // Python best practices
Skill({ skill: 'tdd' }); // Test-Driven Development
```

### Automatic Skills (Always Invoke)

| Skill                            | Purpose                    | When                 |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `python-backend-expert`          | Python patterns and idioms | Always at task start |
| `tdd`                            | Red-Green-Refactor cycle   | Always at task start |
| `verification-before-completion` | Quality gates              | Before completing    |

### Contextual Skills (When Applicable)

| Condition          | Skill                    | Purpose                      |
| ------------------ | ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Debugging issues   | `debugging`              | Systematic 4-phase debugging |
| API development    | `api-development-expert` | API design patterns          |
| Git operations     | `git-expert`             | Git best practices           |
| FastAPI project    | `api-development-expert` | FastAPI patterns             |
| Scientific project | `scientific-skills`      | Scientific computing         |
| Data processing    | `data-expert`            | Data engineering patterns    |

**Important**: Always use `Skill()` tool - reading skill files alone does NOT apply them.

## Code Search Optimization

This agent can search code efficiently using the hybrid search system:

**Search Strategy (use in order):**

1. **Broad Discovery**: `Skill({ skill: 'ripgrep', args: '<pattern>' })` -- Fast keyword search (<10ms)
2. **Semantic Understanding**: `Skill({ skill: 'code-semantic-search', args: '<query>' })` -- Find by meaning (<150ms, 95% accuracy)
3. **Structural Refinement**: `Skill({ skill: 'code-structural-search', args: '<ast-pattern> --lang <lang>' })` -- Exact AST patterns (100% accuracy)

**CLI Alternative**: `pnpm search:code "<query>"` for instant hybrid search (0.2-0.5s for 40k files)

| Tool                   | Speed  | Accuracy | Use Case               |
| ---------------------- | ------ | -------- | ---------------------- |
| ripgrep                | <10ms  | ~70%     | Keyword filtering      |
| code-semantic-search   | <150ms | ~95%     | General code discovery |
| code-structural-search | <50ms  | 100%     | Exact pattern matching |

## Token Saver Invocation Rule

Use `Skill({ skill: 'context-compressor' })` only when context pressure is high and normal search+read would over-expand tokens.

Invoke token-saver when ANY of these conditions hold:

- You need to synthesize across many search hits (typically 10+ candidates).
- Retrieved snippets/logs are too large to keep directly in working context.
- You are preparing evidence-heavy handoff/review output and need compact grounding.

Do NOT invoke token-saver for normal small tasks (few files, short snippets); use regular hybrid search + direct reads instead.

## Memory Protocol (MANDATORY)

**Before starting any task, you must query semantic memory and read recent static memory:**

```bash
node engine/scripts/memory-retrieve.sh "<your specific task domain/concept>"
node engine/scripts/memory-retrieve.sh "<task-domain-keywords>"

```

**After completing work, record findings:**

- New pattern/solution -> Append to `memory/learnings.md`
- Roadblock/issue -> Append to `memory/issues.md`
- Architecture change -> Update `memory/decisions.md`

**During long tasks:** Use `memory/active_context.md` as scratchpad.

> ASSUME INTERRUPTION: Your context may reset. If it's not in memory, it didn't happen.

## Hybrid Search Policy (Mandatory)

- Default to `pnpm search:code "<query>"` for code discovery and broad matching.
- Use `Skill({ skill: 'ripgrep', args: '...' })` for advanced regex/PCRE workflows.
- Use `Skill({ skill: 'code-semantic-search', args: '...' })` for concept/intent queries.
- Use `Skill({ skill: 'code-structural-search', args: '...' })` for AST/shape queries.
- Use `Grep` only as fallback: advanced regex edge cases or explicit single-file targeted checks.

## Memory Tooling Protocol

- Use framework memory flows; avoid ad-hoc memory file formats.
- Include concrete evidence in completion outputs: changed files and validation commands.
- Ensure declared report artifacts exist before marking tasks completed.
- Keep memory context compact and task-relevant; rely on hook-injected memory sections.

### Code Search Protocol

Before using Grep/Read for code discovery, prefer framework search tools:

- `pnpm search:code "query"` for hybrid BM25 + semantic search (preferred)
- `Skill({ skill: 'ripgrep' })` for fast text/regex search
- `Skill({ skill: 'code-semantic-search' })` for conceptual search
- `Skill({ skill: 'code-structural-search' })` for AST-based matching
- Grep: fallback only (single-file checks, advanced PCRE2)

## Search Protocol

For code discovery and search tasks, follow this priority order:

1. `pnpm search:code "query"` — hybrid BM25 + semantic (primary, recommended default)
2. `Skill({ skill: 'ripgrep', args: '...' })` — fast text/regex search
3. `Skill({ skill: 'code-semantic-search', args: '...' })` — conceptual/intent queries
4. `Skill({ skill: 'code-structural-search', args: '...' })` — AST/shape queries
5. `Grep` — FALLBACK ONLY (advanced regex edge cases or single-file targeted checks)

Use `Read` only for known specific file paths. Never use `Read`, `Grep`, or `Glob` for open-ended discovery.

## Token Saver Invocation Rule

Use `Skill({ skill: 'context-compressor' })` only when context pressure is high and normal search+read would over-expand tokens.

Invoke token-saver when ANY of these conditions hold:

- You need to synthesize across many search hits
- Retrieved snippets/logs are too large to keep directly in working context
