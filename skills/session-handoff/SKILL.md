<capabilities>
- Writing the session handoff log securely directly to disk via atomic locks.
- Checking the Active Task database to prevent corruption and cross-session overlap (Drain Gate).
- Spawning a detached cross-platform GUI terminal window using the verified OS decision matrix.
</capabilities>

## When to Use

Invoke this skill:

- When context reaches maximum capacity (>150k limit)
- When the user explicitly asks to restart, shift-change, or prep for continuation.
- Before ending a long work session

## How to Execute (MANDATORY)

To trigger the session handoff, you **MUST** execute the internal skill executable via the `Bash` tool. You shouldn't generate the log yourself—the executable handles all schema management and polling.

```bash
node .claude/skills/session-handoff/session-handoff.cjs
```

### Drain-Complete Gate

If the executable fails and prints `[session-handoff] ABORT: Cannot handoff session while tasks are active.`, you did not follow the drain rule!
You must explicitly use `TaskUpdate` to either mark all active tasks as `completed` OR `suspended` before re-running the skill.

## Required Setup (Context Preservation)

Before running the skill, ensure that `.claude/context/memory/active_context.md` is updated with necessary context you want the next agent to know, as the script will synthesize it into the handoff payload.
