# Architecture Review Workflow

**Extended Thinking**: Architecture reviews require multiple expert perspectives to identify structural issues, security vulnerabilities, and improvement opportunities. This workflow orchestrates specialized agents through four phases - from initial context gathering through analysis, security review, and actionable recommendations. By spawning agents in parallel where appropriate, the workflow maximizes efficiency while ensuring comprehensive coverage of architectural concerns.

## Overview

This workflow performs comprehensive architecture reviews by:

1. Gathering codebase context and existing documentation
2. Analyzing architectural patterns, dependencies, and technical debt
3. Reviewing security posture and identifying vulnerabilities
4. Synthesizing findings into prioritized recommendations

## When to Use

**Recommended triggers:**

- Before major feature development (validate existing architecture can support new features)
- After significant codebase changes (ensure architectural integrity is maintained)
- During technical debt assessment cycles (identify refactoring priorities)
- Onboarding new team members (document current architecture state)
- Pre-security audit preparation (identify issues before external review)
- Post-incident analysis (determine if architecture contributed to issues)

**Complexity indicators:**

| Indicator             | Simple Review | Full Review   |
| --------------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Codebase size         | < 10k LOC     | > 10k LOC     |
| Service count         | Monolith      | Multi-service |
| Team size             | 1-3           | 4+            |
| External dependencies | < 5           | 5+            |
| Security sensitivity  | Low           | Medium-High   |

## Phase 1: Context Gathering

**Purpose**: Build comprehensive understanding of the codebase before analysis.

**Agent**: Developer (exploration mode)

**Parallel exploration**: If codebase has distinct domains, spawn multiple explorers.

### Step 1.1: Codebase Structure Exploration

```javascript
Task({
  task_id: 'task-1',
  subagent_type: 'developer',
  description: 'Exploring codebase structure for architecture review',
  prompt: `You are the DEVELOPER agent in exploration mode.

## PROJECT CONTEXT (CRITICAL)
PROJECT_ROOT: $PROJECT_ROOT
All file operations MUST be relative to PROJECT_ROOT.

## Task
Explore codebase structure to gather context for architecture review.

## Instructions
1. Read your agent definition: .claude/agents/core/developer.md
2. **Invoke skills**:
   - Skill({ skill: "code-analyzer" })
   - Skill({ skill: "project-onboarding" })
3. Map directory structure, identify major components and modules
4. Catalog technologies, frameworks, and external dependencies
5. Identify entry points, API boundaries, and data flow paths
6. Document build system, configuration, and deployment artifacts
7. Save findings to: .claude/context/exploration/architecture-review-structure.md

## Output Format
- Directory tree with component descriptions
- Technology stack summary
- Dependency graph (major components)
- Entry point catalog

## Memory Protocol
1. Read .claude/context/memory/learnings.md first
2. Record discoveries to .claude/context/memory/learnings.md
`,
});
```

**Expected Output**: Codebase map with technology stack, component boundaries, and dependency graph.

### Step 1.2: Documentation Audit

```javascript
Task({
  task_id: 'task-2',
  subagent_type: 'developer',
  description: 'Auditing existing architecture documentation',
  prompt: `You are the DEVELOPER agent.

## PROJECT CONTEXT
PROJECT_ROOT: $PROJECT_ROOT

## Task
Audit existing architecture documentation.

## Instructions
1. Read your agent definition: .claude/agents/core/developer.md
2. Search for existing documentation:
   - README files, architecture decision records (ADRs)
   - API documentation, design documents
   - Diagrams (C4, sequence, ERD)
3. Assess documentation completeness and currency
4. Identify gaps between documented and actual architecture
5. Save findings to: .claude/context/exploration/architecture-review-docs.md

## Output Format
- Documentation inventory
- Coverage assessment (0-100%)
- Currency assessment (stale/current)
- Gap analysis

## Memory Protocol
1. Record documentation gaps to .claude/context/memory/issues.md
`,

   - DRY/KISS/YAGNI compliance
5. Assess coupling, cohesion, and modularity
6. Identify architectural anti-patterns and smell indicators
7. Save analysis to: .claude/context/reports/architecture/architecture-review-patterns.md

## Analysis Framework
| Dimension | Indicators | Rating Scale |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| Modularity | Clear boundaries, single responsibility | 1-5 |
| Coupling | Dependency direction, abstraction levels | 1-5 |
| Cohesion | Related functionality grouping | 1-5 |

   - Design debt (poor abstractions, tight coupling)
   - Infrastructure debt (outdated dependencies, missing automation)
   - Documentation debt (stale docs, missing comments)
5. Estimate remediation effort for each item
6. Prioritize based on impact and effort
7. Save assessment to: .claude/context/reports/architecture/architecture-review-techdebt.md

## Debt Categorization Matrix
| Category | Impact | Effort | Priority |
|----------|--------|--------|----------|
| Critical | Blocks development | Any | P0 |
| High | Slows development | Low-Medium | P1 |
| Medium | Causes bugs | Low | P2 |

---

## Success Criteria

The architecture review is complete when:

- [ ] Codebase structure fully documented
- [ ] All major components and their interactions identified
- [ ] Architectural patterns analyzed with quality scores
- [ ] Technical debt cataloged and prioritized
- [ ] Security posture assessed with threat model
- [ ] Dependencies scanned for vulnerabilities
- [ ] Findings consolidated into actionable recommendations
- [ ] Executive summary prepared for stakeholders
- [ ] Remediation roadmap created with timeline

## Error Recovery

### Phase 1 Failures

**Codebase too large to explore**:

1. Split exploration by domain/module
2. Spawn parallel explorers for independent areas
3. Set exploration depth limits for initial pass

**Missing documentation**:

1. Document gap in findings
2. Proceed with code-based analysis
3. Flag documentation as high-priority recommendation

### Phase 2 Failures

**Unable to identify patterns**:

1. Check if codebase is too small/simple for formal patterns
2. Look for emerging patterns vs. established patterns
3. Document as "pattern-free" if truly ad-hoc

**Complexity analysis timeout**:

1. Focus on hotspot analysis rather than full coverage
2. Use sampling for large codebases
3. Prioritize recently-changed code

### Phase 3 Failures

**Security scan incomplete**:

1. Document what was and wasn't scanned
2. Flag gaps as recommendations for manual review
3. Focus on highest-risk areas first

**Dependency scan failures**:

1. Check for unsupported package managers
2. Fall back to manual dependency review
3. Document unscannable dependencies

### Phase 4 Failures

**Conflicting recommendations**:

1. Architect arbitrates conflicts
2. Document trade-offs for stakeholder decision
3. Provide multiple options with pros/cons
